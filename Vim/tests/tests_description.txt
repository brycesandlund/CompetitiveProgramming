01 |  3 |  5 |  9 | Sample input
02 |  4 |  5 |  0 | Empty Dictionary
03 |  3 |  5 |  1 | Only one single letter to avoid
04 |  4 |  5 | 10 | Several single letters to avoid
05 |  3 |  4 | 26 | All letters to avoid (answer is 0)
06 |  3 |  5 |  8 | Several different words (some start with letters that end other words)
07 |  3 |  5 | 10 | Words that start with prefixes of suffixes other words
08 |  3 |  5 | 12 | Words that have others words as substrings
09 |  4 |  6 | 50 | (small alphabet, many overlaps)
10 |  3 |  6 | 50 | (big alphabet, almost no overlap)
................................ Limit for what I tested with brute force approach
11 |  3 | 10 | 25 | Smallish alphabet (5 letters)
12 |  3 | 15 | 35 | Medium alphabet (10 letters)
13 | 10 | 15 | 45 | Medium A (A=10)
14 | 18 | 18 | 50 | Case with A==B
15 |  4 | 19 | 50 | Close to max (A=min+1, B=max-1)
16 |  3 | 20 |  0 | Max pwd size with empty dictionary
17 |  3 | 20 | 50 | Max pwd size and medium-long words
18 |  3 | 20 | 50 | Max time (max pwd size, max words, all maximum length, max alphabet)
